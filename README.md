# BlueSheepMobile
This is the repository for the Mobile client of Blue Sheep, an application for permission awareness. 
The project is intended to allow users to see how much information they unknowingly produce through their phone'sâ€™ various sensors. 
Once the data is collected, it is sent to an Amazon AWS Server where we use various algorithms to make the data collected comprehensible through the use of charts and how their phone interprets  our habits.
The application is written in Xamarin, thus will be simultaneously deployed as an app for the Android and iOS, allowing us to reach a larger audience and have a universal interface.
